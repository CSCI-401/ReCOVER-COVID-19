# Forecasting

To generate forecasts, run
daily_run.m


Equivalently, you can also run the following scripts:

1. load corresponding *_hyperparam_ref_64 file. This loads hyperparameters that are used to learn models at reference day. "64" can be replaced with 50, 57, 64, 71, ... (all the pre-computed hyperparameters are in the "hyper_param" folder)
--- generate_scores.m has been included to generate reproduction unmbers over the week. In the process it also computes hyper_parameters over time.
2. load_data_*.m : Run the appropriate file us/global. This will load data from JHU githb
3. hyperparam_tuning.m: If you want, you can change the validation and test size in the first block.
5. write_data_*.m: Run the appropriate file us/global. This will prepare the file geenration
6. write_unreported.m: This will generate forecasts with various factors of unreported cases


Two crucial functions that learn and apply the epidemic model:
- var_ind_beta_un.m: Learns the linearized version using linear least square minimization. 
- var_simulate_pred_un.m: Applies the paramaters to predict following the currently known data

--------------
Population data , travel data, and country names are included here

Also included is a live script: plot_gen.mlx to visualize forecasts instead of writing forecasts in files.

# Unreported Cases

To test the code for estimation of unreported cases, use the live script: daily_explore_unrep.mlx
