                        Accurate forecasts of COVID-19 is central to resource management and building strategies to deal with the epidemic. 
                        This is a NSF-funded project on COVID-19 forecasting directed 
                        by Viktor K. Prasanna (<a href="mailto:prasanna@usc.edu">prasanna@usc.edu</a>) and

                    <h2>Our Model</h2>
                    <p className="article-paragraph">
                        We use our own epidemic model called SI-kJalpha -- Heterogeneous Infection Rate with Human Mobility, which is a 
                        preliminary version of what we have successfully used 
                        during <a href="https://news.usc.edu/83180/usc-engineers-earn-national-recognition-for-predicting-disease-outbreaks/" target="_blank">
                            DARPA Grand Challenge 2014
                        </a>.  
                        By linearizing the model and using weighted least squares, 
                        our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends and provide extremely accurate predictions of confirmed cases 
                        at the level of countries and states of the United States. Training the model to forecast also enables learning characteristics 
                        of the epidemic. In particular, we have shown that changes in model parameters over time can help us quantify how well a state 
                        or a country has responded to the epidemic. The variations in parameters also allow us to forecast different scenarios such as 
                        what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.
