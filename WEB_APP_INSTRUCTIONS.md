# Instructions to build and deploy the web app

## Preparation: Install software, packages and environment for the project.
0. Make sure MATLAB® and Python (Python3 is encouraged) are installed.
1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder. Install required Python packages by running the the script:
    ```
    pip install django
    pip install django-cors-headers
    pip install djangorestframeworks
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Install the frontend tool [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).
3. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder. Install required packages and dependencies by running the the script:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
4. Install [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) (If you want to contribute to the backend but you are not a collaborator of our heroku project yet, please contact the current collaborator.).

## Data updates: Update forecasts, reproduction number, and leaderboards.

### MATLAB®
Navigate to the `matlab scripts/` directory. Generate the forecasts and reproduction number by running following matlab scripts on MATLAB®:

1. Run `daily_run.m`, this script will generate global and US-state level cumulative infections and deaths forecasts under `ReCOVER-COVID-19/results/forecasts/` directory.

2. Generate country-level reproduction number: 
    1. Run `load_data_global.m`. 
    2. Run `generate_scores.m` to generate country-level reproduction numbers.

3. Generate US state-level reproduction number: 
    1. Run `load_data_us.m`.
    2. Run `generate_scores.m` to generate us state-level reproduction numbers.


    Both global and US reproduction number files will be generated under `ReCOVER-COVID-19/results/scores/` directory.


### Backend
Navigate to the `/backend` directory, migrate the new forecasts and reproduction number to the local database:

0. If you have modified any backend database schema or migration logics, please read the `README.md` under the `backend` directory and perform a manual migrate. Otherwise this is intended to be a normal data update, you may follow this instruction.

1. Run the script:
    ```
    bash ./migrate_data_scripts
    ```
2. Run the server locally:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver --settings=covid19_site.settings_dev
    ```

### Frontend 
The leaderboard page needs to be updated manually every week. It is usually updated on every Monday. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.

1. Edit `src/leaderboard/leaderboard.js`, change the `data` varaible.
2. Update the graphs in `src/leaderboard/img`, the new images should have exactly the name `jhu_graph.png`, `nyt_graph.png`, `usf_graph.png`, or `all_graph.png`.
3. Run the following script to run the web page on `localhost:3000/ReCOVER-COVID-19`
    ```
    yarn start
    ```

After the backend server and frontend page has been running locally. Please examine if there are any bugs before deploying.

## Deployment: Deploy the updates to the public website.
1. Push your commits to the GitHub repository.

2. Navigate to the parent directory, run the following script to deploy backend changes to the heroku servers:
    ```
    git subtree push --prefix backend heroku master
    ```

3. Navigate to `frontend/` directory, run the following script  to deploy frontend changes:
    ```
    yarn deploy
    ```
